            <p style="color:azure">Demon Targaryen is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones, in which he was portrayed by English actor Kit Harington. In the novels, he is a prominent point of view character. He is one of the most popular characters in the series, and The New York Times cites him as one of the author's finest creations.[1][2] Jon is a main character in the TV series, and his storyline in the season 5 finale generated a strong reaction among viewers. Speculation about the character's parentage has also been a popular topic of discussion among fans of both the books and the TV series.</p>
            <h1 class="hg">The Journey Of Daemon Targaryen</h1>
            <p style ="color:azure" >Yes, his was a cruel fate.

        Jon was a Bastard of Winterfell ridiculed all of his life and recklessly decided to join the Nights Watch before knowing what it truly was.
        
        Tragically, he lost his first and true love.
        
        Jon rose to become Lord Commander freeing thousands of Widlings and uniting them with the Northern houses.
        
        Jon was resurrected from the dead
        
        Jon was made King of the North.
        
        Jon convinced the Dragon Queen to come North and fight the undead
        
        The truth was revealed that Jon was a true born and rightful heir to the 7 kingdoms
        
        Jon did not press his claim and supported his Aunt
        
        Jon killed his Aunt and Queen to protect Westeros and his family from domination and tyranny
        
        Because of this , Jon was banished to the Nightswatch and was told never to take a wife or sire children effectively killing off the Targaryen bloodline.
        
        Worst end of the stick? Jon got the whole rotted tree. Jon saved everyone countless times (from the Wight walkers and from Dany). They all owe him a debt of gratitude including the unsullied and dothraki but what does he get? A life of solitude and loneliness. He gets to go back to the Nights Watch even though he is the rightful heir to everything and he has earned the Iron Throne more than anyone. That was a cruel fate.</p>
